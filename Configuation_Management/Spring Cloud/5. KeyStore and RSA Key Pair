KeyStore and RSA Key Pair ?

Instead of using a single, plain text key (like an AES Key) directly in your configuration file,
This methods uses a keystore
And this keystore a secure file that holds encryption keys

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the keytool command, we can generate an RSA key pair (whe one is public key and another one is private key) and store it in the keystore .

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The key pair is then used by Spring Cloud Config Server to encrypt (lock) and decrypt (unlock) sensitive data like database passwords

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How it works ?
1. Encryption :
When you want to secure a property, the config server uses  the public part of the key pair (managed by keystore) to encrypt tht value
2. Decryption :
When a client request the configuration, the server uses the private part to decrypt the property before sending it .


How it is different from AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) ?
AES is like having one master key for a safe,
while RSA is like having a lock and key pair where one is public (to lock) and another is private (to unlock)
